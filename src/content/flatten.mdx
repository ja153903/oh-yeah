Suppose that you're given an array that contains either a number or another array. Flatten the array such that all the
values exist on a single level.

For example, if we had the array `[1, [2, 3, [4, 5]]]`, we would expect that the result is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

This problem lends itself to be recursive in nature because of how an array could contain more arrays which would
need to unpack so that all the values will exist on a single level.

For each item in the array, there are two possible operations:

- If the item is a number, then we add that number to our resulting array
- If the item is an array, then we should recursively call the function with the current array.

Here's a straightforward implementation for this algorithm:

```javascript
function flatten(array) {
  const result = []

  for (const item of array) {
    if (Array.isArray(item)) {
      result.push(...flatten(item))
    } else {
      result.push(item)
    }
  }

  return result
}
```

This solution takes advantage of the spread operator in JavaScript and the variadic nature of the `push` method's arguments list.
the `result.push(...flatten(item))` line makes sure that we recursively call `flatten` with the `item` which is currently an array
and then spreads the result of the recursive call into `result.push` which allows us to push any number of items into the
array.

Another recursive solution we can offer here is by using the `Array.prototype.flatMap` method with recursion.

```javascript
function flatten(array) {
  if (!Array.isArray(array)) {
    return array
  }

  return array.flatMap((item) => flatten(item))
}
```

We reduce the verbosity of the solution by provide a sleek functional solution.
`Array.prototype.flatMap` helps us make sure that any array solution we receive gets flattened by one level.

For example, if we did something like,

```javascript
;[1, 2, 3].flatMap((num) => [num, num * 2])
```

We would expect that the solution is `[1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 6]` rather than `[[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6]]`
because `flatMap` makes sure that the values are hoisted up one level from the array.
