# {metadata.title}

A trie is a tree-like data structure where each level of the tree can contain an arbitrary number of
child nodes. In most cases, we'll typically have up to 26 given that we use tries a lot to represent
characters in our alphabet. This is the very use-case that we'll go over.

Let's start by first defining our initial node data structure

```typescript
class Trie {
  value: string
  children: Map<string, Trie>
  isWord: boolean

  constructor() {
    this.value = value
    this.children = new Map()
    this.isWord = false
  }
}
```

The simplest implementation for a node for now will have the following items:

- the `value` at the point
- `children` containing any child nodes
- `isWord` an indicator whether the string to this point can be considered its own word

So let's do a test run and insert a word into the trie. Suppose that we want to add the word `race` into the
trie. We'll need a method that will allow us to insert the word from the root trie node.

```typescript
class Trie {
  // Omitting implementation from above
  insert(word: string) {
    let current: Trie = this

    for (const character of word) {
      if (!current.children.has(character)) {
        // we'll set a new Trie node entry
        current.children.set(character, new Trie())
      }

      const child = current.get(character)
      if (!child) {
        throw new Error(
          'Absurd error. But we define it anyway to satisfy typescript'
        )
      }

      current = child
    }
  }
}
```

The above method iterates over each character of the word we're trying to insert and creates a new entry into the children's map
if it wasn't set before.
